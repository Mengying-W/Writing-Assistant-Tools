This repository contains the datasets and essential code used in the project. The project is structured into three main components:

1. **Data Preparing**: This section includes the process of generating rephrased text using three large language models (LLMs).
2. **Embedding Generation**: Here, we utilize various language models to generate embedding vectors for text at three different levels of granularity (word, sentence, paragraph).
3. **Analysing Methods**: This part contains various methods for analyzing the text data.

The dataset（annotated data） consists of text collected from multiple sources and the rephrased text generated by traditional WATs and three LLMs. The distribution of the dataset structure is documented in the corresponding tables.
