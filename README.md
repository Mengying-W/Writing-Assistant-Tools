# Writing-Assistant-Tools

This repository contains the datasets and essential code used in the project. The project is structured into three main components:

1. **Data Preparation**: This section includes the process of generating rephrased text using three large language models (LLMs).
2. **Embedding Generation**: Here, we utilize various language models to generate embedding vectors for text at three different levels of granularity (word, sentence, paragraph).
3. **Analysis Methods**: This part contains various methods for analyzing the data.

The dataset consists of text collected from multiple sources and the rephrased text generated by traditional WATs and three LLMs. The distribution of the dataset structure is documented in the corresponding tables.

The overall project flowchart is shown below:
