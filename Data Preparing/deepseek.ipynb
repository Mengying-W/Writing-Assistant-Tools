Each dependency is a directed, two-word relationship connecting a head word to its dependent or modifier. There are three key reasons why dependency structures are worth examining. First, dependency-based approaches have gained significant traction in NLP, with extensive efforts dedicated to creating large annotated datasets for these methods. The Universal Dependencies dataset (Nivre et al. 2017), utilized in this work, has been particularly impactful. Second, dependency structures have a well-established role in machine translation, even though constituency-based approaches have often been prioritized (Williams et al. 2016). Third, because dependencies are word-to-word relationships, they can be easily derived from a neural machine translation (NMT) model. This aligns well with the methodological framework adopted in our study.

Our models are built on top of pretrained BERT parameters. In the simplest case, we learn to predict the author or subject guilt ratings without any other supervision.

In addition, we explore unsupervised pretraining on a modestly-sized unlabeled corpus of crime stories, finding that it too increases the effectiveness of SuspectGuilt models.

Latent variable grammars augment the observed parse trees in the treebank with a latent variable at each tree node. This effectively splits each observed category into a set of latent subcategories. An EM-algorithm is used to fit the model by maximizing the joint likelihood of parse trees and sentences. To allocate the grammar complexity only where needed, a simple split-and-merge procedure is applied. In every splitmerge (SM) round, each latent variable is first split in two and the model is re-estimated. A likelihood criterion is used to merge back the least useful splits (50% merge rate for these experiments). This iterative refinement proceeds for 7 rounds, at which point parsing performance on a held-out set levels off and training becomes prohibitively slow. Since EM is a local method, different initializations will result in different grammars. In fact, Petrov (2010) recently showed that this EMalgorithm is very unstable and converges to widely varying local maxima. These local maxima correspond to different high quality latent variable grammars that have captured different types of patterns in the data.

      "{'original': 'We evaluated methods for self-training high accuracy products of latent variable grammars with large amounts of genre-matched data. We demonstrated empirically on newswire and broadcast news genres that very high accuracies can be achieved by training grammars on disjoint sets of automatically labeled data. Two primary factors appear to be determining the efficacy of our self-training approach. First, the accuracy of the model used for parsing the unlabeled data is important for the accuracy of the resulting single self-trained grammars. Second, the diversity of the individual grammars controls the gains that can be obtained by combining multiple grammars into a product model. Our most accurate single grammar achieves an F score of 91.6 on the WSJ test set, rivaling discriminative reranking approaches (Charniak and Johnson, 2005) and products of latent variable grammars (Petrov, 2010), despite being a single generative PCFG. Our most accurate product model achieves an F score of 92.5 without the use of discriminative reranking and comes close to the best known numbers on this test set (Zhang et al., 2009). In future work, we plan to investigate additional methods for increasing the diversity of our selftrained models.

      "{'original': 'Another popular graph method is the random walk algorithm, which is successfully employed by the PageRank approach for ranking Web pages (Brin and Page 1998). Similar to the minimum-cut algorithm, here, nodes represent semantic entities (e.g., words), and edges represent associations between the nodes (e.g., word co-occurrence). The random walk algorithm allows for the classification of each node based on the relevance of its neighbors. For example, Mihalcea (2006) uses random walk for WSD by constructing a graph in the following way. Each node represents an ambiguous (test) word, or a (training) word labelled with one of its senses. Each edge indicates that the corresponding two words co-occur in some context. The sense of an ambiguous word is determined by the sense of its most relevant neighbor(s), by randomly traversing the graph until an equilibrium state has been reached. Hughes and Ramage (2007) also use a random walk method, with the goal of determining semantic relatedness between individual words (not sets of words, as in our work).

Dual decomposition leverages the observation that complex inference problems can often be decomposed into efficiently solvable sub-problems. The approach leads to inference algorithms with the following properties: • The resulting algorithms are simple and efficient, building on standard dynamic-programming algorithms as oracle solvers for sub-problems, together with a method for forcing agreement between the oracles. • The algorithms provably solve a linear programming (LP) relaxation of the original inference problem. • Empirically, the LP relaxation often leads to an exact solution to the original problem.

For example, Bock (1986) and Gries (2005) analyze particular constructions like passive voice, dative alternation, and phrasal verb particle placement, while Dubey et al. (2005) investigate noun phrase internal structure. In this study, we expand on these findings by analyzing the distribution of all syntactic productions in the Penn Treebank WSJ corpus. Our findings show that syntactic consistency is pervasive across different types of LHS nonterminals, including the most frequently occurring ones.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

For our experiments we asked 6 human evaluators, proficient in both English and Hindi, to create English SMS queries based on the general topics that our FAQ collection dealt with. We found 60 SMS queries created by the evaluators, had answers in our FAQ collection and we designated these as the in-domain queries. To measure the effectiveness of our system in handling out of domain queries we used a total of 380 SMSes part of which were taken from the NUS corpus (How et al., 2005) and the rest from the “out-of-domain” queries created by the human evaluators.

He pulled hard over, attempting an S turn which would avoid both vehicles, but before he could complete it his own van ran on to the narrow verge, bumped along for a few more yards, then ploughed to a stop, with its side in the hedge.

Speaking to CNN from Red Square, Ponomarev acknowledged Putin’s enduring popularity, stating, “He remains among Russia’s most favored politicians—likely the top—so a majority vote is expected.” However, he added, “The margin shouldn’t be so large, and a runoff should have been necessary.”  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version keeps the original meaning while improving flow and readability.

He is a former Minister of Economic Development in Romano Prodi’s government from 2006-8 – and has held a comfortable lead in polls, but that appears to be gradually being eroded by Berlusconi. Italy’s political system encourages the forming of alliances, and the Democratic Party has teamed with the more left-wing Left Ecology Freedom party. The 61-year-old Bersani comes across as “bluff and homespun, and that’s part of his appeal – or not, depending on your point of view,” said political analyst James Walston, department chair of international relations at the American University of Rome. He described Bersani, a former communist, as a “revised apparatchik,” saying the reform-minded socialist was paradoxically “far more of a free marketeer than even people on the right.” Bersani has vowed to continue with Monti’s austerity measures and reforms, albeit with some adjustments, if he wins. At second place in the polls is the center-right alliance led by Berlusconi’s PdL, in coalition with the right-wing, anti-immigration Northern League.

From 2000 to 2010, researchers at the University of Washington and Ohio State University monitored the vast rivers of ice that course across the world’s largest island. Their results, published this week in the peer-reviewed journal Science, found that glaciers in northwestern and southeastern Greenland flowing toward the Arctic and Atlantic oceans picked up speed by about 30%, on average. “Glaciers are continuing to accelerate, which means they are continuing to put more ice into the ocean,” said University of Washington at Seattle glaciologist Twila Moon, the paper’s lead author. “And as soon as that ice hits the ocean, it’s contributing to sea-level rise.” But Moon said her group’s data suggests that contribution will be less than existing worst-case scenarios.

When combined with the 1990s’ average yearly increase of 1.5 ppm, the WMO notes that radiative forcing—the climate’s warming effect from long-lasting greenhouse gases—has surged by 30% since 1990. WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud warned in a statement that these extra billions of tons of CO₂ will persist in the atmosphere for centuries, further heating the planet and disrupting life on Earth. The WMO estimates that since the industrial revolution began in 1750, roughly 375 billion tons of carbon have been emitted, with about half absorbed by natural carbon sinks. However, the WMO cautions that oceans and forests, which store carbon naturally, may not maintain this capacity indefinitely. Jarraud added that rising CO₂ absorption is already making oceans more acidic, which could harm marine food chains and coral reefs.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version keeps the original meaning while improving flow and readability.

      "{'original': '“Speeding” is a relative term. Many of the roughly 200 glaciers studied move less than the length of a football field per year; others flow about a mile annually. One glacier in northern Greenland was clocked going from 50 meters to 650 meters a year (about 160 feet to 2,100 feet) over the course of seven years. The research was funded by NASA and the National Science Foundation. Most of Greenland is covered by a sheet of ice that averages more than a mile thick. NASA says its observations indicate the ice sheet is shedding up to 50 billion tons of water a year.

He explained that the crew, likely fatigued at this late hour, became overly focused on the issue—a known phenomenon. Many past accidents have involved pilots obsessing over minor issues while neglecting bigger concerns. While the exact cause remains uncertain, the aircraft’s behavior suggested a lack of deliberate control. Whether it was completely uncontrollable—which he doubts—or simply uncontrolled, the pilots were not actively managing it. Picture this scenario: at 2 a.m., two tired pilots face an unexpected issue. With little else to occupy them, they concentrate on solving the problem, overlooking the autopilot’s disengagement. Meanwhile, the plane begins a gradual, unnoticed descent. When they finally check their instruments, they distrust the readings, become disoriented, and fail to regain control. He referenced a 2004 incident where a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 crashed into the Red Sea after takeoff from Sharm el Sheikh due to pilot disorientation. Although Egyptian officials contested this conclusion, French and U.S. investigators, including the NTSB, attributed the crash to spatial disorientation based on available evidence.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

Sightings will be plotted on a map, using different colored pins denoting whether the specimen is unchecked, uncertain or likely. “We made it in a weekend – a lot of late nights, a lot of coffee,” said Toby Hammond of the University of East Anglia’s Adapt Group, which is behind the initiative. “It’s a huge task to map this disease – if you were to do it thoroughly, you’d have to look at every ash tree in the UK,” he said.

Meanwhile, Labour could lose up to 15 of its own marginals to the Lib Dems (according to party estimates, at least). The election will ultimately be decided by around 100 direct Labour-Conservative battleground seats. Labour’s leadership interprets Cleggmania in two ways: a) Some support comes from centre-right voters who might have chosen the Tories but now prefer Clegg, and b) Another portion—dubbed \"Vincemania\"—reflects centre-left voters advocating for electoral reform and banking changes. In past elections, Lib Dem voters in Labour-Tory marginals have tactically opposed the Conservatives, but if this trend fades, Labour’s position could worsen dramatically. Additionally, a new, hard-to-measure demographic is emerging. My conversations with party workers and pollsters suggest many young, first-time voters are driving Cleggmania. If the Lib Dems have indeed harnessed the \"anti-politics zeitgeist,\" their influence isn’t just a swing—it’s a fresh, disruptive force in the election.*  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version keeps the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

India resisted language that would explicitly require the deal to be legally binding. The deadlock was broken when a Brazilian diplomat proposed the compromise term “legal force,” which all parties accepted. The roadmap was initially proposed by the EU, along with the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) bloc.*  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

Capitalism has been dominant in the Western world since the end of mercantilism. It was fostered by the Reformation, which sanctioned hard work and frugality, and by the rise of industry during the Industrial Revolution, especially the English textile industry (16th–18th centuries). Unlike earlier systems, capitalism used the excess of production over consumption to enlarge productive capacity rather than investing it in economically unproductive enterprises such as palaces or cathedrals.

Rule by dictators has taken several different forms. In Latin America in the 19th century, various dictators arose after effective central authority had collapsed in the new nations recently freed from Spanish colonial rule. These caudillos, or self-proclaimed leaders, usually led a private army and tried to establish control over a territory before marching upon a weak national government. Antonio López de Santa Anna in Mexico and Juan Manuel de Rosas in Argentina are examples of such leaders. (See personalismo.) Later 20th-century dictators in Latin America were different.

      "{'original': 'When a volume of air at a given temperature holds the maximum amount of water vapour, the air is said to be saturated. Relative humidity is the water-vapour content of the air relative to its content at saturation. Saturated air, for example, has a relative humidity of 100 percent, and near the Earth the relative humidity very rarely falls below 30 percent. Unsaturated air can become saturated in three ways—by evaporation of water into the air; by the mixing of two masses of air of different temperatures, both initially unsaturated but saturated as a mixture; or, most commonly, by cooling the air, which reduces its capacity to hold moisture as water vapour sometimes to the point that the water vapour it holds is sufficient for saturation. This atmospheric cooling can be brought about in a number of ways, as by the arrival of a cooler air mass or by the movement of an air mass up a mountain side.

French mathematician Joseph Fourier is sometimes given credit as the first person to coin the term greenhouse effect based on his conclusion in 1824 that Earth’s atmosphere functioned similarly to a “hotbox”—that is, a heliothermometer (an insulated wooden box whose lid was made of transparent glass) developed by Swiss physicist Horace Bénédict de Saussure, which prevented cool air from mixing with warm air. Fourier, however, neither used the term greenhouse effect nor credited atmospheric gases with keeping Earth warm. Swedish physicist and physical chemist Svante Arrhenius is credited with the origins of the term in 1896, with the publication of the first plausible climate model that explained how gases in Earth’s atmosphere trap heat. Arrhenius first refers to this “hot-house theory” of the atmosphere—which would be known later as the greenhouse effect—in his work Worlds in the Making (1903). The atmosphere allows most of the visible light from the Sun to pass through and reach Earth’s surface. As Earth’s surface is heated by sunlight, it radiates part of this energy back toward space as infrared radiation. This radiation, unlike visible light, tends to be absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, raising its temperature.

Only a small number of untouched old-growth forests remain in eastern North America today.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

Near warmer water bodies, such as lakes, evaporation can lead to lake-effect snowfall downwind, particularly in the cold cyclonic flow behind extratropical cyclones. These snowfalls can be intense in localized areas. Thundersnow may occur in a cyclone’s comma head or within lake-effect snow bands. Mountains often experience heavy precipitation on their windward slopes, where rising air enhances rainfall or snowfall. Conversely, the leeward side of mountains may develop desert conditions as descending air warms and dries. The tropics receive the majority of Earth’s precipitation, driven by convective processes. Rainy seasons in savannahs are triggered by the shifting monsoon trough, also known as the intertropical convergence zone.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

Biometric devices can map minutiae in a single fingerprint and then compare it with an exemplar on file, conduct a retinal or iris scan of the eye, measure and map an entire handprint, or create a digital map of the face. Biometric facial-mapping systems, or “facecams,” when linked to offender databases and CCTV cameras in public places, can be used to identify offenders and alert police.

Senators are handpicked by the Prime Minister—an elected official—rather than chosen by the public. Moreover, every decision the Senate makes must ultimately be approved by the elected House of Commons. Unlike the House of Commons, the Senate lacks cabinet ministers who wield executive power, and it can’t pass laws on its own. In the end, all Senate actions depend on the approval of the elected House of Commons. Additionally, the Senate is largely composed of ex-MPs who once held elected office, mainly serving as a patronage system for party loyalists. The core problem is that it offers politicians a lifetime sinecure—as long as they stay in the Prime Minister’s good graces. While the Senate is undemocratic, it isn’t the fatal flaw in Canada’s democratic system. Canada’s democracy faces real challenges—eroding trust in institutions, breaches of fundamental freedoms, a flawed electoral system that misrepresents voters, and weak checks and balances—not the monarchy or an unelected Senate. I get it—terms like \"monarchy\" and \"unelected Senate\" hardly scream democracy; they even carry an authoritarian ring.

VR should be marketed in physical stores like Target or Best Buy, with straightforward hardware compatibility guidelines, well-defined software options (physical packaging would help), and visually appealing games. Facebook is failing in all these areas, particularly when compared to Steam. Valve, led by ex-Microsoft employees, excels in customer communication by successfully addressing all three aspects.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

Oddly enough, due to today’s economy, homeowners may discover that a straight-cool system can cost just as much—or even more—than a heat pump (as the Grinch might say, it’s a strange world). However, heat pumps tend to save on electricity since they only require power to circulate the freon. The freon absorbs heat on its own. As it changes from liquid to gas, the freon releases the captured heat. This means the system doesn’t generate heat—it simply facilitates the transfer process. In contrast, a straight-cool system relies on a heater to distribute warmth through the ducts.*  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version keeps the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

To Jennifer, his beloved wife; to Eliana and Malana, his beautiful, wonderful daughters; to the Mother Emanuel family and the people of Charleston, the people of South Carolina. I cannot claim to have the good fortune to know Reverend Pinckney well.  But I did have the pleasure of knowing him and meeting him here in South Carolina, back when we were both a little bit younger. Back when I didn’t have visible grey hair. The first thing I noticed was his graciousness, his smile, his reassuring baritone, his deceptive sense of humor -- all qualities that helped him wear so effortlessly a heavy burden of expectation.

Al Qaeda terrorists and Sunni insurgents recognized the mortal danger that Iraq's elections posed for their cause, and they responded with outrageous acts of murder aimed at innocent Iraqis. They blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam -- the Golden Mosque of Samarra -- in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq's Shia population to retaliate. Their strategy worked. Radical Shia elements, some supported by Iran, formed death squads. And the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today. The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people -- and it is unacceptable to me. Our troops in Iraq have fought bravely. They have done everything we have asked them to do.

      "{'original': \"Sure, some are looking for opportunities in this new world. That's the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice. But while there might be some short-term individual winners, our collective losses will far outweigh them. Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events. The military gets it. They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security, while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond. So what can we do? How can we prepare and adapt? I'd like to share three sets of examples, starting with adapting to violent storms and floods. In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans, with sections knocked out in Katrina, have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge. And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward. The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher, it's poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country. They're selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels, reflective paint and more. Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars. Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way, but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind. For example, in Galveston, here's a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike, when others on neighboring lots clearly did not. And around the world, satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh.\", 'stepwise': 'Certainly, some see potential in this changing world. For instance, the Russians have placed a flag on the ocean floor to assert their rights to minerals beneath the melting Arctic ice. However, even if a few benefit temporarily, the broader consequences will be far more damaging. The insurance industry, grappling with escalating losses from extreme weather, is a clear example. The military understands this too—they label climate change a \"threat multiplier\" that could undermine global stability, prompting governments to assess their responses. So, what steps can we take? How do we adapt and prepare? Let me outline three approaches, beginning with resilience against storms and floods. In New Orleans, the I-10 Twin Spans, destroyed by Hurricane Katrina, were reconstructed 21 feet higher to withstand stronger storm surges. Similarly, Brad Pitt’s Make It Right initiative built elevated, energy-efficient homes in the heavily damaged Ninth Ward. Even my mother’s church, devastated by the storm, was not only raised but also designed to be the nation’s first Energy Star-certified church. With solar panels, reflective paint, and other upgrades, it now generates surplus electricity—its March bill was just $48. While New Orleans serves as a model for rebuilding, proactive measures elsewhere could prevent such devastation. Take Galveston, where one resilient home survived Hurricane Ike while neighboring houses were destroyed. Globally, satellite technology and early warning systems are reducing fatalities in flood-prone regions like Bangladesh.  \\n\\n*(Note: I followed your instructions—breaking the original into sentences, rephrasing each, then weaving them back together.

That’s an enormous amount of cosmic real estate, though most of these planets are likely inhospitable—think Mercury or Neptune. Neptune, for instance, probably doesn’t play a major role in your daily life. The real question is: how many of these planets could support life? We don’t have a definitive answer yet, but NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope will help us find out soon. Experts working on this project estimate that roughly one in a hundred—or at worst, one in a thousand—planets might be habitable. Even using the most conservative estimate (one in a thousand), that still leaves us with at least a billion Earth-like planets in our galaxy alone.

When multiple programmers collaborate, conflicts arise easily: they might overwrite each other’s changes or introduce conflicting commands that crash the system, and this issue escalates with team size. Essentially, managing a large software project boils down to preventing this kind of organizational chaos. For years, the standard solution has been a tool called a \"version control system,\" which, true to its name, manages versions of code. It maintains a master copy of the software on a central server. Only authorized programmers can modify it, and even then, they can only edit the specific parts they have permission to change. Diagrams of version control systems typically follow a consistent structure, often resembling this.  \\n\\n---  \\n\\nThis version preserves the original meaning while improving clarity and flow.

It‘s never, from my point of view, as a director coming onto the film, my intention to be a slave to the franchise, as it were.

It‘s never, from my point of view, as a director coming onto the film, my intention to be a slave to the franchise, as it were.  \\n5. The writers presented us with a script that is very, very respectful and very, very subtly acknowledging the mythology, but it‘s very much an origin story, in the real sense of the word, ironically so, bearing in mind that we‘re talking about an origin of the species here.  \\n6. So that, in itself, sets it apart from other films in the franchise, and it‘s a real first, in that respect.  \\n7. It‘s set in the modern day, and it doesn‘t deal with humanoid apes.  \\n8. It deals with apes that are of our world.  \\n9. We set out to tell that, first and foremost.  \\n10.

The script we received pays deep respect to the lore while subtly weaving in references, yet it truly functions as an origin story—ironically, since we’re exploring the origins of an entire species.  \\n6. This approach makes the film unique within the series, marking a first in many ways.  \\n7.

Yes, this is one of the challenges that interested me about accepting this role is the fact it's a very concentrated story.

How many surveys did you carry out during that time? We’d need to check the annual reports, but I don’t have them with me right now. The number depended heavily on the weather. There were days when flying wasn’t possible. In some years, bad weather could ground us for seven to ten consecutive days. During an ideal weather year, we might fly for up to two months. In a favorable year, we could complete around 45 flights in two months, though sometimes it dropped to just 20. Flight durations ranged widely, from two hours to as long as eight or ten hours. If the plane had extra fuel capacity—like internal tanks—we’d usually refuel. But generally, six hours was the fuel limit. Could you walk me through a standard day of aerial surveying? What was your role? Occasionally, I worked as the data recorder—essentially handling the computer systems. The crew usually included a pilot, copilot, data entry specialist, and primary and secondary observers in the rear. Everyone wore headphones, and all systems were connected to the computer. The aircraft was equipped with specialized software and hardware. Every sighting was tagged with geospatial data. When someone spotted something, they’d call it out, press \\'enter,\\' and an Access database would open. The data recorder would then log details like species, weather conditions, sea state, and other variables.
